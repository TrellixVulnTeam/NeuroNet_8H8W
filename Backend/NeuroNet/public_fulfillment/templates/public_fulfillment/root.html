<p>The corona virus spread and infect people all over the world.
<p>Changing any aspects of our life. Medicine, Economic, tourism, education, employment and many more that we cannot even anticipate.                                                                                            </p>
<p>A nasty result of evolutionâ€¦.                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>
<p>But we have the advantage to make ideas to be collectively evaluate between us.                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>We propose a new strategy for win the corona virus.                                                                                                                                                                           </p>
<p>Our secret weapon is the idea that an amazing new level of cooperation shall make humanity to win.                                                                                                                            </p>
<p>We just need to as many people to believe this idea.                                                                                                                                                                          </p>
<p>Reading this mean that you are already "infected" with this idea and maybe be a carrier  ðŸ˜Š                                                                                                                                   </p>
<p>The way to do this is to make as many people to communicate and cooperate, harvest, proliferate, incubate, develop and support the best ideas and technology for facing all the challenges, corona's and maybe many more.     </p>
<p>Open source projects, contributed by anyone, anywhere. No matter where you are.                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>Number 1 solution for not being board, using all the "spare time" of stay at home.                                                                                                                                            </p>

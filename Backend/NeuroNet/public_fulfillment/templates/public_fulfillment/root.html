<p>The corona virus spread and infect people all over the world.
<p>Changing any aspects of our life. Medicine, Economic, tourism, education, employment and many more that we cannot even anticipate.                                                                                            </p>
<p>A nasty result of evolution….                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>
<p>But we have the advantage to make ideas to be collectively evaluate between us.                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>We propose a new strategy for win the corona virus.                                                                                                                                                                           </p>
<p>Our secret weapon is the idea that an amazing new level of cooperation shall make humanity to win.                                                                                                                            </p>
<p>We just need to as many people to believe this idea.                                                                                                                                                                          </p>
<p>Reading this mean that you are already "infected" with this idea and maybe be a carrier  😊                                                                                                                                   </p>
<p>The way to do this is to make as many people to communicate and cooperate, harvest, proliferate, incubate, develop and support the best ideas and technology for facing all the challenges, corona's and maybe many more.     </p>
<p>Open source projects, contributed by anyone, anywhere. No matter where you are.                                                                                                                                               </p>
<p>Number 1 solution for not being board, using all the "spare time" of stay at home.                                                                                                                                            </p>

<p>Now, we all realize that instead of doing a "traditional" hackathon is dangerous, we better perform as many small groups sessions, all communicate together at the same time.                                                 </p>
